This is a simple function object that calculates the wetted surface of a floating object and prints the value in each time step. The wetted surface is simply calculated as the total surface area of all cell faces of the patch having the value of the phase field fraction 0.5 or higher. The threshold of 0.5 can also be adjusted. The wetted surface is a useful metric for tracking overall convergence that goes beyond standard OpenFOAM ESI implementation. Also, it could serve as a benchmark value for comparing different interface tracking methods.
